# California House Pricing

In this project, Ordinary Least Squares Regression is conducted to analyze the factors affecting Housing prices. The dataset consists of information about houses in a California district and some summary statistics based on the 1990 census data.

## Project Questions

1. Which variables have statistically significant effects on `median_house_value`?
2. How do geographical factors influence `median_house_value`?
3. What role does housing age play in determining `median_house_value`?
4. What is the impact of median income on `median_house_value`?
5. How does proximity to the ocean influence `median_house_value`?
6. How well does the model fit the data?

## Steps

### 1. Data Preparation
- Import the dataset and perform data cleaning and exploration.
- Convert categorical data to numerical format.

### 2. Modeling
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to check if assumptions are met.

### 3. Evaluate the Results

## Outcomes

Overall, the model demonstrates a good fit with an R-squared value of 0.646, indicating that approximately 64.6% of the variance in median house values is explained by the included variables. These findings provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the real estate industry, policymakers, and urban planners, aiding in better understanding the factors driving median house values in a given area.
